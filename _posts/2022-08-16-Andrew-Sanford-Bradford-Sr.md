### **Story**
Andrew Sanford Bradford was born in 1815 in North Carolina. At some point between 1830 and 1840, he moved to Greene County, Tennessee. He married Susan Ann Laughner in 1837. 

Greene county is located on the eastern border of Tennessee. After the United States became independent, Greene County was formed in 1783 through a division of the original Washington County, North Carolina. During the Civil War Greene County was largely Unionist. In 1861, during the weeks immediately preceding the Civil War, the State’s largest and most important pro-union meeting occurred at the Greeneville Convention. As with much of East Tennessee, those in Greene County were generally Unionist and opposed to secession on the eve of the Civil War.[^1]

Tennessee prospered and developed rapidly between 1806 and 1819. Thirty-six of Tennessee’s ninety-five counties were formed between 1796 and 1819. Isolated settlements developed quickly into busy county seats. A county seat is the town from which the county’s government operates.[^2] Greeneville is the county seat for Greene county.

Despite the growth of towns, Tennessee remained mostly rural. Log cabins remained the most common type of housing. Eighty percent of Tennesseans were farmers, and most worked simply to supply the food needs of their families. 

Most types of manufacturing, like spinning cloth, soap-making, and forging tools, were done in the farm household. Household chores were mostly divided by gender. Women were generally responsible for preserving food, cooking, producing cloth and clothing, and caring for children. Men cleared fields, planted crops, forged tools, and cared for animal herds. Children performed many chores such as gathering eggs, milking cows, and working alongside their parents. Some families ran businesses to process farm products.[^2]
