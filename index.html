        <h1>The nBradfords</h1>
        <p>As I've been researching my family history, I was dumbfounded at the sheer size of this family.
            There are several different lines of Bradfords that date back to the Mayflower. From my research 
            so far, I don't think my line of Bradfords descended from the Mayflower. But this geneology study
            is as ever changing as the Bradford family dynamics themselves. I am hoping to uncover the origins
            of my Bradford line throughout this ongoing project.
